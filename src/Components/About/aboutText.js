  A year into my path down the working world, I found myself fascinated by the then hot field of 
  machine learning (circa 2016; these were the days). I taught myself to code, and used the 
  logical thinking and self-ingrained 
  discipline from my maths degrees to enter the field as a data scientist/ML engineer. 
  I enjoyed the problem-solving aspect of it, but after a while realised that more than making predictions 
  about the future based on usually insufficient training data, I enjoyed finding the patterns, and missed 
  the act of creating something.

  I used to enjoy art in my childhood and back then believed that one day I would be 
  an artist. That never came to be, but through a series of seridipity and luck, including my venture into the world of 
  Japan, I found myself drawn to the field of data visualisation - a marriage of creativity, insight and critical thinking 
  which I deeply appreciate.
